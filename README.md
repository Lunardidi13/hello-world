Hello World!

I am Adrianus Lunardi Pradana from Indonesia. I was born in Jakarta, 20th November 1999. 

I just started using github and this is my first repository. This repository will contain files that were created during my learning process of github.

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of my progress and as a recollection for me to look back when I first start using github.
