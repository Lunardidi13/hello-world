Hello World!

I am Adrianus Lunardi Pradana from Indonesia. I was born in Jakarta, 20th November 1999. 

A quick introduction about me is that I just finished my master degree of Computer Science in BINUS University and currently preparing myself with the essential skills for work.

I am interested in Web and Mobile Programming. I have some basic knowledge about said subjects and I'm trying to improve it.

I just started using github and this is my first repository. This repository will contain files that were created during my learning process of github.

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of my progress and as a recollection for me to look back when I first start using github.

Thank you for reading this short paragraph! Have a good day~
